# Federal Shutdown's Shadow: SNAP Benefits in Limbo for November

As the federal government shutdown stretches into its second month, a critical question looms large for millions of American families: what will happen to November 2025 Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits? While states have worked tirelessly to ensure October payments were made, the prolonged impasse threatens to disrupt vital food assistance for those who need it most.

Initial reports indicated that many states, including North Carolina, New York, and Massachusetts, were able to secure October SNAP benefits despite the shutdown, often through proactive measures and emergency funding. For instance, North Carolina's Department of Health and Human Services confirmed that SNAP benefits would continue through October 2025, albeit with warnings about potential future disruptions if the shutdown persisted (Source: [NCDHHS](https://www.ncdhhs.gov/divisions/child-and-family-well-being/food-and-nutrition-services-food-stamps)). Similarly, New York's Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance advised that October payments would proceed on a normal schedule (Source: [NY OTDA](https://otda.ny.gov/policy/gis/2025/25DC063-Attachment-1.pdf)). Massachusetts also assured its residents that October benefits were issued on time (Source: [Mass.gov](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/federal-shutdown-october-2025)).

However, the outlook for November is considerably grimmer. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), which oversees SNAP, has limited flexibility in a prolonged shutdown scenario. Several states have begun to issue dire warnings. Washington State's Department of Social and Health Services explicitly stated that if federal funding is not restored, they would be unable to issue food benefits after October 31st (Source: [DSHS Washington](https://www.dshs.wa.gov/alert/partial-federal-government-shutdown)). New Jersey also informed its residents that November 2025 SNAP benefits might not be available on time if the shutdown continues (Source: [NJ.gov Human Services](https://www.nj.gov/humanservices/njsnap/)).

While some states, like Minnesota, anticipate being able to provide at least partial SNAP and MFIP food benefits in November based on recent federal court rulings, the situation remains fluid and uncertain for many (Source: [Minnesota DCYF](https://dcyf.mn.gov/federal-shutdown)). The Food Research & Action Center (FRAC) has been monitoring the situation closely, emphasizing that while October payments were largely secured, the longer the shutdown, the greater the risk to future benefits (Source: [FRAC](https://frac.org/blog/how-will-government-shutdown-affect-snap-benefits)).

The ongoing federal shutdown highlights the fragility of essential social safety nets when political impasses occur. Millions of families rely on SNAP to put food on their tables, and any disruption can have immediate and severe consequences. As November approaches, all eyes remain on Washington, hoping for a resolution that will safeguard these critical benefits.
